Although not explicitly imported, running the delay discount analyses requires
    rpy2, as it uses pymer4. pymer4 is imported in do_lmer(...) because it is
    slow to load. I believe using rpy2 and pymer4 requires you to have R 
    installed with the lme4 and lmerTest packages. If you do not have this set
    up, I think the easiest way to set this up (or at least to install rpy2)
    is via Anaconda. pip sometimes mishandles complex packages like this.
    (tensorflow and CUDA is another example of software that pip struggles with)

        Although not reported in the paper (for brevity), preliminary analyses
        were performed examining whether the delay discounting led to greater
        model fit. It did. There was also an interesting pattern associated
        with part two where the relationship between the delay weighing
        and model fit led to two local maxima, suggesting both shorter
        and longer term expectations. None of the analyses on model fit were
        reported in the main text or Supplemental Materials.
